# Machine learning algorithm visualizer/UI based HyperParameter tuning application

### Try it out - [project Link](https://share.streamlit.io/eklavya99/ml_algo_viz/main/app.py)

This is an interactive learning and exploration tool that lets user pick an algorithm and a dataset of his choice and lets him/her play arround with the algorithm's hyperparameters while 
showing instantly how any change in hyperParameters values affect accuracy & decision boundry computed by the algorithm.

## Motivation
Often times when people first start out with ML getting an intuitive idea about how model's paraneter affect the output and accuracy can be vague.
This tool can be used to understand how model's parameters afftect accuracy and various other things in ML like overfitting, underfitting, generalization and decision boundry. Not only that it can also be used as a tool to explore different sets of hyper parameters and how each affects the model's accuracy.

## Frameworks used
This project was made using [python](https://www.python.org/) and following python libraries - [streamLit](https://streamlit.io/) [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) [numpy](https://numpy.org/) [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)


## what I learned
How to create an app using streamLit and deploy it
working with Sklearn

## what's next for this project 
I've had a few extra idea that i'll add to this project in future, like -
1) Using optuna to do automatic hyperParamter optimization
2) option to let user upload his/her own data
3) descriptions of ML algorithms, so that it can be a better learning resource
4) add more hyperParameter options for tweaking the algorithm
